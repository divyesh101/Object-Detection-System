# Real-Time Object Detection with OpenCV 


This Python script uses OpenCV and a pre-trained SSD MobileNet model to detect objects in real-time using a webcam feed.

Overview:
This project captures video from a webcam and applies a pre-trained SSD MobileNet model for object detection. The SSD MobileNet model is optimized for fast and efficient object detection tasks.

Features:

Video Capture: Uses OpenCV to capture video frames.
Object Detection: Applies SSD MobileNet to detect objects in each frame.
Visualization: Draws bounding boxes around detected objects and labels them.
Interactivity: Displays real-time object detection on the webcam feed and exits on 'q' key press.
